# Iris
This is a simple OpenGL application whose main purpose is learning Graphics in general and more modern C++. A TODO list will be added and updated as I progress through this journey.

You should be able to compile & run this under *most* Windows or Linux machines with the following requirements:
  - `OpenGL>=4.6;`
  - `clang>=9;`
  - `gcc>=8;`

## Assets
To actually run the targets present in this you will need **assets**, reference the [models](models) folder.
