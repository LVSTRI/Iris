# Models
You can download the Models used from the [Khronos glTF Samples Repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models).
These models should be directly extracted in this folder:
  - Used in the [MousePicking](../src/2.1) target: [A Beautiful Game](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/ABeautifulGame);
  - Used in the [Framebuffers](../src/3.1) target: [Sponza](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/Sponza);

See each of the models' README for more information.
